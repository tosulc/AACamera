Simple version of ScanColors app. Uses only one color to match on screen. Have some bugs which are fixed in ScanColors.
It's full of commented code. Also, it's crying for optimization and prettier code (also nicer graphics). 

No TODO 'cause it's just a simple version of ScanColors app.

Why this name for the app? Only to appear on top when I wanted to reinstall it (for testing purposes :)).

Have fun!
